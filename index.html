                    <h2>Hello, my name is Lana and i'm happy to introduce you to my fluffy ball of nerves, Vivi</h2>
                    <p>I have loved cats since childhood, and as an adult, I really wanted to get a cat, but I was a little afraid that it would not be affectionate, because I love to pet them and hear them purr contentedly when they sleep... I hesitated for a long time, and three years ago I saw an advertisement that they were giving away little kittens. Among these cute kittens, I found my Vivi.</p>
                    <p>When I brought her home, she was so small, hiding under the bedâ€”I gradually got her used to me. I played with her, fed her, cared for her, let her sleep in my bed, and taught her to sleep with me. That's why she likes to stretch out on me, and now she probably thinks she's my boss. Over time, she became bolder, and I realized that she could be mischievous: she climbed on the curtains, scratched the wallpaper, and jumped on the cabinets. My fluffy little monster is always in a playful mood, but she is so gentle and affectionate. It's especially nice when I come home and she greets me. I am happy that she came into my life.</p> 
                    <p>Know that every animal needs love. Don't be indifferent. After all, we can become their whole world for their entire lives!</p>
